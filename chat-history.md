# Chat History

---

## Exchange 1 — 2026-02-23

**User:** Implement the following plan:

> Maintain a markdown file at `chat-history.md` inside the repository that records the full conversation history across all prompts and responses. Every time the user sends a prompt and I respond, the exchange is appended to the document. File format uses `## Exchange N — YYYY-MM-DD` headings with **User:** and **Claude:** sections. The document is append-only.

**Claude:** Created `chat-history.md` at the repository root. The file will be updated with each new exchange going forward. Responses are recorded in full or summarized if very long (large code blocks noted by filename rather than reproduced verbatim).

## Exchange 3 — 2026-02-24

**User:** Implement the following plan: Swipe Right (Like) — wire up right drag dismiss and likeBtn.

**Claude:** Implemented swipe right (like). Changes: added `.card--exit-right` to `styles.css`; fixed `dismissCard` guard to check both exit classes and apply direction-based class; added `else if (dx > DISMISS_THRESHOLD)` branch in `pointerup`; wired `likeBtn` to `dismissCard(getTopCard(), 'right')`. User confirmed functionality working.

## Exchange 4 — 2026-02-24

**User:** You are a senior engineer. Analyze the codebase and provide findings for implementing "Swipe up – Super like" and "Double-tap – Look at the other photos in the profile".

**Claude:** Produced 10 findings across both features:

**Super Like (Swipe Up):**
1. `dismissCard` (`app.js:78`) has no `'up'` branch — extend direction handling
2. No `.card--exit-up` CSS class — add `translateY(-140%) scale(0.8)` exit
3. No super stamp CSS (`.stamp--super`, `.card--show-super`) — add using `--super` variable
4. `pointermove` only tracks `dx`, not `dy` (`app.js:96`) — capture `startY` and compute `dy`
5. `pointerup` ignores vertical threshold (`app.js:118`) — add `dy < -DISMISS_THRESHOLD` branch
6. `superLikeBtn` is a stub (`app.js:216`) — wire to `dismissCard(..., 'up')`

**Double-tap Photo Gallery:**
7. Profile object has one `img` string, not a `photos[]` array (`app.js:53`) — generate 2–4 images per profile
8. Card renders a single `<img>`, no slider or dots (`app.js:149`) — build multi-image gallery structure
9. No double-tap detection exists — add tap timer in `pointerup`; left half = previous photo, right half = next photo
10. `transition: none` on `.card--dragging` (`styles.css:148`) is too broad — will suppress inner photo crossfades; scope it to transform/opacity only

## Exchange 2 — 2026-02-23

**User:** Look into this repository and tell me everything I should know as a developer who is going to be building features for it.

**Claude:** Performed a full codebase exploration. Summary: vanilla JS/HTML/CSS frontend-only Tinder clone, no framework, no backend, no tests, no build step. Key files: `app.js` (all logic), `styles.css` (dark theme, BEM-ish classes), `index.html` (DOM skeleton), `data.js` (unused ES6 module duplicate of app.js data). Buttons are intentionally stubbed; swiping is not implemented. Images from Unsplash. Run with any static HTTP server. See full developer guide provided in response.
